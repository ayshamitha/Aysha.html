	<h1>Aysha's Portfolio</h1>
	<p>
		This is a portfolio, culminating my projects in the Computer Science Course at OCADU. This course consists of 5 projects. This website itself is project #1! Feel free to navigate it! This website is my very first attempt at programming and so far, it has been a lot of fun to create!

	<H2>About Me</H2>
	<p>
		My name is Aysha Mitha. I am in second year Environmental Design student at OCAD University. I really love exploring and going on my own mini adventures. My favourite colour is Tiffany Blue, and I love to paint! In my free time, I am usually always on netflix, or organizing something. I enjoy reading, and ALWAYS read the book first, before I see the movie. I feel like thats the only right way to go about with book adaptations! I recently got a puppy, he is a 7 month old Siberian Husky, named Storm...or Cookie...or Puppy. He kind of goes by all three :) 

		My best friend inspired me to take this computer science course so that I can expand my skillset, and learn something that is really useful in the real world. Shout out to my best friend AKA Dopamine Shot, this website is totally dedicated to you! And I could not had done it without your encouragements! All my amazing bffs know how to program, and I would also like to take this space to shout out to Doritos for being so nice to me when I sent that file, and to Pepsicola for calling me an idiot. I would also like to shout out to Triple AAA, for not replying to his messages.
